        <div><h1>Berserk</h1><p>Berserk (Japanese: ベルセルク, Hepburn: Beruseruku) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Kentaro Miura. Set in a medieval Europe-inspired dark fantasy world, the story centers on the characters of Guts, a lone swordsman, and Griffith, the leader of a mercenary band called the "Band of the Hawk". Miura premiered a prototype of Berserk in 1988. The series began the following year in the Hakusensha's now-defunct magazine Monthly Animal House, which was replaced in 1992 by the semimonthly magazine Young Animal, where Berserk has continued its publication. Following Miura's death in May 2021, the final chapter that he wrote and illustrated was published posthumously in September of the same year; the series resumed in June 2022, under supervision of Miura's fellow manga artist and childhood friend Kouji Mori [ja] and Miura's group of assistants and apprentices from Studio Gaga.</p></div>

        <div><h1>The origins</h1><p>While briefly working as an assistant to George Morikawa at 18, Miura had already planned some ideas for Berserk's development, having a dark warrior with a gigantic sword illustrated in his portfolio who would be the first conception of Guts.[5][6] Miura submitted manuscripts to a shōnen manga magazine for about four years before working for Hakusensha. However, he felt that he was not capable enough for it and they were also not interested in publishing science fiction or fantasy works.[7] In 1988, while working with Buronson on a manga titled King of Wolves,[8] Miura published a prototype of Berserk in Hakusensha's Gekkan ComiComi.[9][10] This 48-page prototype placed 2nd at the 7th ComiComi's Manga-School prize.[11] He later submitted his work to a magazine that, at the time, "was on the verge of going under," and he was switched around between several editors before meeting his first editor.[7] The serialization of Berserk began in Hakusensha's Monthly Animal House in 1989.[9][12] Miura commented that he landed the serial as soon as he made his debut, so he never had the opportunity to receive much criticism from editors.[7]

        <div><p><h1>Concept and influences</h1>
          Miura stated that the inspiration for the series' title was diffuse at the time of creation. He did not have information about the berserkers or the Berserker Armor (which first appeared in the 222nd chapter) planned out from the start. He chose the word, telling himself that "its mysterious aspect would stick well." Miura said that the title was connected to Guts' imagery, influenced by Mad Max's eponymous character, further elaborating: "In short, starting from a world with a dark hero who is burning for revenge, prompts you to imagine a rabid character. When, guided by his anger, he will pour out this rage on overpowered enemies, we must insist on his fanaticism if you want to stay consistent. That's why I thought "Berserk" would make a perfect title to represent my universe."[13] According to Miura, the series' dark fantasy setting was inspired by the 1982 film Conan the Barbarian and the Elric of Melniboné series.[14][15][16] Miura stated that he did not see dark fantasy as a genre in itself, but rather as an equivalent of general fantasy. He commented that outside of Japan the big works of fantasy, like The Lord of the Rings, contain dark elements, and in Japan, the fantasy genre was popularized by video games like Dragon Quest, which were aimed at children, and therefore, expurgated the dark elements, but since he received the influence from novels before that of those games, Miura "naturally turned to dark fantasy."[15][16]
          
          Miura said that Fist of the North Star, by Buronson and Tetsuo Hara, was the work that had the greatest impact on his own work,[7] helping as well to develop his art style.[17][18] Miura also mentioned animator and manga artist Yoshikazu Yasuhiko and manga artist Fujihiko Hosono as early influences to his art style. Violence Jack by Go Nagai and Guin Saga by Kaoru Kurimoto inspired the series' story and atmosphere. Ranpo [ja] by Masatoshi Uchizaki served him as a reference for his backgrounds.[17][18] Miura said that his favorite manga series was Dororo by Osamu Tezuka, and that he wanted to create a fantasy work that possessed dark, "muddy" and yōkai-like elements.[19] Miura was also influenced by Star Wars,[20][21] adding that he learned the basics of storytelling from George Lucas and called the eponymous 1977 film his favorite work.[22] Miura commented about the influence of shōjo manga on the series, stating that it is about "expressing every feeling powerfully."[17][23] Particularly, he mentioned influence from Yumiko Ōshima,[17][23] and that the anime adaptations of The Rose of Versailles and Aim for the Ace!, both directed by Osamu Dezaki, inspired him to read The Rose of Versailles manga and the works of Keiko Takemiya, notably Kaze to Ki no Uta.[16][24]
          
          Some aspects of Guts (personality and design) were partially inspired by Miura's highschool friend and later fellow manga artist Kouji Mori [ja], by Mad Max, and by Rutger Hauer's performances in Flesh and Blood, Blade Runner, The Hitcher and The Blood of Heroes.[25][7][14][13] Guts' prosthetic hand was inspired by Dororo's Hyakkimaru and Cobra eponymous protagonist.[26] Kurt, the protagonist of Pygmalio [ja], by Shinji Wada, and an illustration of a giant wielding a sword, featured in The Snow Queen (Guin Saga spin-off), inspired the size of Guts' sword, the Dragon Slayer, by mixing both characters' swords.[17][18] Miura commented that when drawing the Dragon Slayer, he wanted to emulate the effect of Kenshiro's or Raoh's (Fist of the North Star) fist "flying out from the page," but he felt that Guts' sword did not have the same feeling of weight as a fist. He wanted to convey an "extension of reality" feel to the sword, similar to the depiction of the Fist of the North Star's Hokuto Shinken martial art, and make it believable for the readers.[27] Miura stated that "Black Swordsman" Guts was the first thing he was set on, but he did not have any idea about what his backstory would be. He focused on the character development up until around the third or fourth volume and then he would think about what brought him to revenge.[7]
          
          Frequency
          Berserk is known for its frequent and often extended hiatuses,[28] which date back to late 2006.[29] Following a chapter of the main storyline released in February 2012, three consecutive chapters about Guts' childhood were published from June to July of the same year.[30][31][32] The main storyline resumed after eight months in October 2012,[33][34] and the series went on hiatus after a chapter published in December of the same year.[35] Miura took a break to work on his 6-chapter mini-series Giganto Maxia,[36] and Berserk was published intermittently from April to September 2014.[37][38][39][40] After a 10-month hiatus, the manga came back in July 2015,[41] and was published monthly until November of the same year,[42] before entering on hiatus.[43] It was published monthly from June to September 2016, before entering another hiatus.[44][45] The manga resumed publication from March to June 2017,[46][47] and was then published on a monthly basis from December 2017 to May 2018.[48][49] Four months after, another chapter was published in August 2018, before entering an 8-month hiatus.[50][51] Two chapters were published in April[52][53] and August 2019.[54][55] Three chapters were published in April,[56] July[57] and October 2020, respectively.[58] A chapter was published in January 2021.[59]</p></div>

        <div><p><h1>Miura's death and series resumption</h1>
          On May 20, 2021, Hakusensha announced that Miura died at 54 due to an acute aortic dissection on May 6, leaving it undecided what would happen to the series.[60][61][62] The posthumous 364th chapter of Berserk was published in Young Animal on September 10 of the same year, which was Miura's last work, and members of Miura's Studio Gaga, which consisted of him and his group of assistants and apprentices,[63][b] worked to finish the manuscript of the chapter.[65] The magazine's issue was a "memorial" to Miura, featuring a special "Messages to Kentarou Miura" booklet and a poster of "famous scenes" from the manga.[66][67] In the same issue, Hakusensha stated that the future of the series remained uncertain and that the staff's priority would "always be placed on him — what he would think if he were still with us."[68][65] The afterword in the manga's 41st volume (released in December 2021) from Young Animal's editorial staff stated that the future of the manga was still undecided.[69]
          
          On June 7, 2022, Hakusensha and Kouji Mori announced that the series would continue publication, using plans and thoughts that were relayed to Mori by Miura himself, as well as memorandums and character designs that Miura left behind.[70] Mori related how he had visited Miura nearly 30 years ago when the latter was drawing "the Eclipse" event of Berserk and how his friend completed the storyline for the manga up to its last chapter that week. Mori explained that the story for Berserk had since gone on "exactly as we discussed at the time, with almost no changes."[70] As the only person who knows the ending Miura intended, Mori agreed to continue the series and promised, "I will only write the episodes that Miura talked to me about. I will not flesh it out. I will not write episodes that I don't remember clearly. I will only write the lines and stories that Miura described to me."[70] Berserk continued with six chapters finishing the "Fantasia Arc/Elf Island Chapter" before starting a new arc afterward, with the credits as "original work by Kentaro Miura, art by Studio Gaga, supervised by Kouji Mori".[70][63][71] The 365th and 366th chapters were published on June 24, 2022.[63][72]</p></div>

        <div><p><h1>Themes</h1>Berserk explores a wide range of themes and topics. Free will, destiny, and causality are discussed within the series.[73][74][75] Human resilience is a recurring theme, with many characters coming from traumatic backgrounds, constantly struggling against an unjust world.[75][76] Guts struggles with destiny itself and is constantly resisting the pull of predetermination.[73] Griffith also embodies this idea of resilience, by chasing his dream of ruling his own kingdom, despite his lowborn origins, as well as free will, by his own decision to sacrifice the Band of the Hawk in order to achieve his dream.[75]

          The series also explores human nature and morality, as characters struggle between becoming good human beings or falling into madness and evil.[77][76] Guts, at the beginning of the story, is presented as an antihero who does not care about killing and is indifferent to people who aid him. Guts does not act in accordance with definitions of right and wrong, he operates within a gray area, and does not attempt to be heroic or protect the innocent.[78][79] However, as the story progresses, it is shown that he is in fact a person who is deeply conflicted internally.[80][81] His tragic and traumatic past, unfolded in the Golden Age arc, proves that Guts is a much more complex character.[82][78][76] Anne Lauenroth of Anime News Network wrote that Griffith is "not evil at all," but "arrogant and brutally realistic about human nature." The suppression of his own human nature would initiate his demise as the Hawk and the rise of Femto.[75]
          
          Friendship, comradery and human relations are other explored themes.[73][16] As a child, Guts tried to build some level of friendship with his mercenary group,[83] but due to his traumatic experience with them, he lost trust in people.[84][85][86] However, through the time he was with Griffith and the rest of the Band of the Hawk, Guts formed bonds, friendships, animosities and co-dependencies, maturing as well as individual.[76][75][87][74] Miura stated that he based the Band of the Hawk on his own high school friend relationship experience.[16][88] Specifically, he mentioned that his friendship with later fellow manga artist Kouji Mori partially inspired the relationship between Guts and Griffith.[7] Jacob Chapman of Anime News Network, wrote that through their friendship, Guts' ambitions were elevated and Griffith's were lowered, allowing both of them to consider a new future for the first time, one where they fight side by side as equals and die on the battlefield, but they reject this future out of their own personal fears, as Guts did not think he was "good enough" for a happy future and Griffith was terrified of his lofty dream crumbling into something more mundane.[89] Miura also said that the story of fight between Guts and Griffith speaks about their change after having built their personalities.[16]
          
          The Golden Age arc has been compared to a Greek tragedy.[90][91] According to Lauenroth, Griffith's hamartia lies in how he compartmentalizes his feelings of guilt and shame that would get in the way of his dream and how he deals to repress them. His inner dialogue in his second duel with Guts, "If I can't have him, I don't care," marks the Golden Age arc peripeteia.[75] When Guts comes running to rescue him during the Eclipse, Griffith reaches his moment of anagnorisis with his thought: "You're the only one... who made me forget my dream."[75]
          
          Betrayal and revenge are major themes in the series. Guts suffered his first betrayal when Gambino sold Guts' body to another soldier for a few coins. He would eventually take revenge against the soldier, killing him on the battlefield and he later would kill Gambino as well.[76][84] Guts is in a quest for revenge after his comrades were betrayed by Griffith and sacrificed by the God Hand.[76] This desire for vengeance has been his main reason of survival.[92][79]
          
          Religion has been also touched in the series, mainly through the characters of Mozgus and Farnese. Miura stated that he created Mozgus based on the concept of rigid personality to create a religious fanatic character with no flexibility.[88] Farnese is presented as the figurehead of the Holy Iron Chain Knights, inquisitors tasked with burning heretics and witches at the stake.[93] After her encounter with Guts, she finds it increasingly difficult to resolve her faith with the atrocities she became party to, as Guts, inversely, takes action against something he disagrees with. Guts denounces the very idea of prayer, claiming that the act of clasping hands only prevents people from fighting for their lives. Farnese eventually begins to reject her faith and the rigidity of her beliefs after finding out the truth about Mozgus. After the battle between Guts and Mozgus, Farnese decides to follow Guts, to find a new purpose in her life, away from her social position and the church.[94]</p></div>
